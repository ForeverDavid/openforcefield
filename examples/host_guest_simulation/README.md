# Setting up a host-guest simulation using SMIRNOFF parameters

This attempts to provide an example of how easy it is to set up rather nontrivial simulations with SMIRNOFF force fields.
In this case we will begin with a guest SMILES string and a 3D structure of a host, dock the host into the guest, solvate, and proceed to simulations.
