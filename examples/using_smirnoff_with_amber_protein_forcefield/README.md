## Combining a SMIRNOFF parameterized small molecule with an AMBER parameterized protein using ParmEd

This example illustrates how the [ParmEd](http://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/html/index.html) utility can be used to merge a small molecule parameterized by SMIRNOFF with a traditionally parameterized protein (or other biopolymer) to create a fully parameterized protein-ligand system.
